# Single-Cycle-RISC-Processor-Design

Our processor KGP-RISC has the above Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).
Assume that the processor has a 32 bit word, with all the registers and memory
elements having 32 bit data. The address line of the memory is also 32 bits.
We are to develop first the op-code format for the above instruction set,
identify the data path element and design the data path along with the control
signals. Subsequently, we shall first develop a single-cycle instruction execution
unit for KGP-RISC.
